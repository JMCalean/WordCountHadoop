Part 1 is the WordCount program.  The input is bible+shake.nopunc file spilt among 15 files.
The output of the program is an alphabetically sorted list of word frequency for each task node.

Part 2 is the double word count program.  The input is the same as part 1.  The output is 
in alphabetic order of the first word with an attached frequency for each task node.

Part 3 is the distributed selective word frequency for a selected list Part 3 is unfinished.
Input should be a the input directory of the complete bibles+shake.nopunc, output directory, and dictionaryList
Didn't have  time to debug because of family emergency.
